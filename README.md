# What's this app for? 
This is for my thesis project. You can collect 5 types of sensor data from your Android phone while biking and a local AI model decides whether you biked slowly, normally or intensively.

# Features
- Data collection for an indefinite or for a pre-determined time by the user
- Stop a currently running collection
- Predicting your biking style in every 30/60 seconds
- Select if you want prediction while collecting
- Save the collected data in a CSV
- Delete accumulated data
